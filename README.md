# The Powerful Mod
Have you ever wondered what Balatro would be like if someone added an exponent on the chips? No? That's fine, I did it anyway.

Currently the Powerful mod adds:
- The Pow mechanic
- 16+ jokers
- Glow in the Dark card edition (+ a new Spectral to apply it)
- An overhaul to Green Stake that is more thematically cohesive with Pow
with plans for plenty more!

This concept arose from a desire to add a fresh layer of strategy for players who are already very familiar with Balatro's core mechanics. Certain aspects of the game such as skipping blinds and chip builds felt a bit neglected, so hopefully this mod provides some fun new ways to play the game!

Please feel free to play and give me feedback, I'd love to hear what you think!
